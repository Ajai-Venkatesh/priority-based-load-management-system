## 🔍 Overview

This system monitors supply voltage in real-time and intelligently manages three relay-controlled loads. When supply voltage drops below thresholds, lower-priority loads are automatically shed (switched OFF) to protect high-priority loads. Time-of-day awareness allows different priority profiles for daytime and nighttime operation.

```
[AC Supply] → [Voltage Sensor] → [Arduino MCU] → [Relay 1] → [Load 1 - HIGH Priority]
                                               → [Relay 2] → [Load 2 - MEDIUM Priority]
                                               → [Relay 3] → [Load 3 - LOW Priority]
```

## ⚙️ Priority Logic

The system operates on three voltage threshold bands:

| Voltage Range | Action |
|---|---|
| V ≥ V_HIGH | All 3 loads ON |
| V_MED ≤ V < V_HIGH | Load 1 (HIGH) ON, Load 2 ON, Load 3 OFF |
| V_LOW ≤ V < V_MED | Load 1 (HIGH) ON, Load 2 OFF, Load 3 OFF |
| V < V_LOW | All loads OFF (undervoltage protection) |

Default thresholds (configurable in `config.h`):

```cpp
#define V_HIGH  220.0   // All loads ON above this
#define V_MED   200.0   // Shed LOW priority load
#define V_LOW   180.0   // Shed MEDIUM priority load
#define V_CRIT  150.0   // All OFF (undervoltage)
```

## 🌅 Day/Night Mode Switching

The system reads real time from a DS3231 RTC module and switches priority profiles:

| Mode | Active Hours | Priority Profile |
|---|---|---|
| **Day Mode** | 06:00 – 21:59 | LIGHTING > HVAC > FAN |
| **Night Mode** | 22:00 – 05:59 | SECURITY > LIGHTING > HVAC |

Configure in `config.h`:

```cpp
#define DAY_START_HOUR   6
#define NIGHT_START_HOUR 22
```

| A4 | RTC SDA | I2C Data (DS3231) |
| A5 | RTC SCL | I2C Clock (DS3231) |

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Voltage Sensing**: The voltage sensor outputs a scaled analog signal (0–5V) proportional to the input voltage. The Arduino reads this on pin A0 and maps it to actual voltage using a calibration factor.

2. **Time Reading**: The DS3231 RTC provides current hour. The Arduino checks if it is day or night and loads the corresponding priority profile.

3. **Priority Decision**: Based on the measured voltage and the active priority profile, the Arduino decides which relays to energize (ON) or de-energize (OFF).

4. **Hysteresis**: A small deadband prevents relays from rapidly switching when voltage hovers near a threshold.

5. **Output**: Relay states are updated, loads are connected or disconnected, and status is printed to Serial Monitor (and optionally to LCD).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| All relays OFF always | Voltage reading too low | Check sensor wiring, recalibrate `VOLT_FACTOR` |
| Relays chattering | No hysteresis | Increase `HYST_BAND` in `config.h` |
| Wrong day/night mode | RTC not set | Run `firmware/set_rtc_time.ino` once |
| Incorrect voltage reading | Sensor calibration off | Run `firmware/calibration_tool.ino` |
| Relay not switching | Wrong pin or relay logic | Check `RELAY_ACTIVE_LOW` setting |
